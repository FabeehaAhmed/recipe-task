    <div>
        <ul type="square">
            <li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup confectioners' sugar for dusting</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>METHOD</h2>
        <ol type="a" >
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch round pan.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a
                time, mixing until fully incorporated; stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt;
                stir into the batter alternately with the milk. If the batter is too stiff, a tablespoon or two of milk
                may be added. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out
                clean. Cool in pan on a wire rack, then turn out onto a serving plate. Dust with confectioners' sugar
                right before serving.</li>
            <li>Delicious cake is ready.</li>
